Compete and win NFT prizes

The 'challenge' is:

<i>A small tournament contract where participants get an NFT with their position: champion, 2nd, 3rd, etc
simple enough to be minimal-proxied so anybody can easily mint one.
we don't even need a standard just a defacto standard contract people use for fun.
let's make a tournament</i>

This is my very first "training wheels off" smartcontract creation, so please be gentle haha
